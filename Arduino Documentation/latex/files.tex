\item\contentsline{section}{Arduino Code/\hyperlink{fullcounter_8c}{fullcounter.\+c} \\*This class is the code that is run on the Arduino. This file sets up the lcd screen that is used to setup the box when it is deployed, and has the implementation for setting which lot is being recorded at deployment. But most importantly, it is the code that actually uses the sensor to record whether or not a car has passed the sensor. It sends this information to the Raspberry Pi which then sends the information to the database }{\pageref{fullcounter_8c}}{}
