This is the Tamu Driver project for Jonathan Westerfield, Jonathan Beechner, and Joel Coatney. This project has 
all of the source code for a box that will allow a user to build a box that can record the amount of cars 
entering and exiting a parking lot or multiple parking lots.

Also include the source files for the web front end that allows you to visualize the data on a line graph with the ability to add a regression line to the graph.
